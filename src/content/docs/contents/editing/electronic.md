## System Overview

The smart conveyor system integrates several electronic components to ensure automated waste sorting by color. The system operates in several sequential stages to detect, identify, and sort waste autonomously.

### Operating Principle

The conveyor remains stationary until waste is detected. Once detected, the system activates the motor to move the waste to the sorting zone, identifies its color, transmits data to the server, and indicates the appropriate bin via LEDs.
