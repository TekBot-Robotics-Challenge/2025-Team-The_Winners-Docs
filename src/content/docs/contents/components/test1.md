## Proccess


### Power Supply Design   

---

#### System Overview  

![Power Circuit](/img/circuit.png)  

A custom-designed power supply built around a **220V to 15V transformer**, **bridge rectifier**, **filtering capacitor**, and a **buck regulator (LM2596-5)**, with added **current limiting circuitry** and **visual indicators**.  

---

#### Transformer  

- **Transformer**: 220V/15V – 30VA  
- **Current Output**:  
  
  I<sub>2</sub> = 30VA / 15V = 2A

- Provides galvanic isolation and sufficient power for the system.

---

#### Rectifier  

- **Type**: Full-wave bridge  
- **Specs**: 3A average current, ≥ 21.21V reverse voltage  
- **Component**: 3A/400V molded rectifier (recycled from a PC PSU)  

---

#### Filter Capacitor  

- **Target Ripple (∆Ve)**: 3.5V  
- **Worst-case current**: 2.01A  
- **Calculation**:  
  
  C = 2.01 / (100 x 3.5) ≈ 6483.9 µF

- **Used** : 4700µF + 3300µF = 8000µF / 25V

---

#### Regulation  

**--> LM7805 Limitations**

- Max 1.5A output → insufficient  
- High heat dissipation → requires heatsink  

**--> LM2596-5 Buck Converter**

- **Max current**: 3A  
- **Current-limited** externally to 2A  
- **Efficient** with minimal heat → no heatsink needed  
- **Module includes**: regulator, capacitors, diode, and inductor  

---

#### LED Indicator  

- **LED Specs**: 2.1V @ 20mA  
- **Resistor value**:  
  
  R = (5V - 2.1V) / (0.02A) = 145Ω 
  
 Use **R = 150Ω (E24 standard)**

- **Power dissipated**:  
  
  P = R.I<sup>2</sup> = 145 / (0.02)<sup>2</sup> = 58mW 

Use 1/4W resistor

---

#### Current Limiting Cell  

![Limiter Circuit](/img/me0.png)  

- **Components**:  
  - Transistor: 2N2222  
  - Optocoupler: PC817  
  - Shunt Resistor: R4 = 0.35Ω  
- **Operation**:  
  - Below 2A → regulator ON  
  - ≥ 2A → Q1 conducts → optocoupler cuts off LM2596 via ON/OFF pin  

- **R3 Calculation**:  
  
  R<sub>3</sub> = (12.5V - 1.2V - 0.2V) / 0.02A ≈ 555Ω
  
Use 600Ω, 1/4W

#### MPU6050

![Img1](/img/me3.jpg)

As kids, the gyroscopes at the science fair never failed to amaze us because they moved in strange ways and even seemed to defy gravity. Their unique properties make them crucial in everything from small RC helicopters to the advanced navigation system on the space shuttle.

In recent years, ingenious engineers have successfully developed micromachined gyroscopes. These MEMS (microelectromechanical system) gyroscopes have paved the way for an entirely new set of innovative applications, including gesture recognition, enhanced gaming, augmented reality, panoramic photo capture, vehicle navigation, and fitness monitoring, to name a few.

Without a doubt, the gyroscope and accelerometer are each exceptional in their own way. However, when we put them together, we can obtain incredibly precise data about an object’s orientation. This is where the MPU6050 enters the picture. The MPU6050 includes a gyroscope and an accelerometer, allowing us to measure rotation along all three axes, static acceleration due to gravity, and dynamic acceleration due to motion.

Le module au cœur de ce test est le MPU6050, un composant clé pour la perception de mouvement dans de nombreux projets robotiques et d'inertie. Il s'agit d'une unité de mesure inertielle (IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit) 6 axes, combinant un accéléromètre et un gyroscope sur une seule puce.

- The module includes a **temperature sensor**, useful for **compensating drifts** due to **thermal variations**.  

---> **Operating Voltage**

- The **MPU6050** operates over a voltage range of **3.3V to 5V**, making it **compatible with the Arduino Uno**.  
- No need for a **voltage level converter** if the module already incorporates a **regulator**.  

---> **Why MPU6050 ?**  

The **MPU6050** was chosen for this test due to its ability to provide **high-quality orientation and motion data**, essential for **navigation and stabilization applications**.

### Circuit Diagramm

#### Electric Schematic

The diagram below provides a visual illustration of the component layout and electrical connections used for this test. It has been designed to provide a clear and intuitive representation of the assembly. All critical components, such as the Arduino Uno microcontroller and MPU6050 sensor, as well as the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), are shown with their pins clearly identified (VCC, GND, SDA, SCL, etc.). We've taken care to respect the standard color conventions for wires (red for power, black for ground, and distinct colors for data signals) to improve readability and facilitate wiring verification.

![Img1](/img/me5.png)

![Img1](/img/me6.png)

Based on this image, which shows the pinout of the UNO board, there are 20 digital pins, so if we divide the maximum current that the ATMEGA 328P can deliver by these 20 pins, we have an average current of 20mA per pin.


#### Resistor sizing method for efficient LED ignition. 

![Img1](/img/me7.png)

---> **Resistor Calculation**

Using the formula:  

<center>

R = <sup>(V<sub>out</sub> - V<sub>th)</sub></sup> / I
<br />

where V<sub>out</sub> = 5V , we calculate:  

R<sub>GREEN</sub> = <sup>(5V - 1.9V)</sup> / 0.015A
<br />

R<sub>GREEN</sub> = 206.6 Ohms
<br />

</center>

Using the **E24 standard series**, the closest standard resistor value for **R_GREEN** is:  

<center>

**R<sub>GREEN</sub>= 220 Ohms**

### Code Description  

Just after the **"Libraries Used"** section, we declared **constant variables**:  

```cpp
const int led1 = 4;
const int led2 = 5;
const int led3 = 6;
const int led4 = 7;
const int led5 = 8;
const int led6 = 9;
```
#### LCD Initiliazation 

```cpp
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);
```
#### Custom characters for LCD display

The code defines several custom character sets (called set1_char0 to set6_char5). Each 8-byte byte array represents a 5x8 pixel character pattern. 
Here's an example showing the 8-byte byte array representing a heart

![Img1](/img/me14.png)

In our code, these characters are used to display symbols on the LCD screen that represent directions of movement (for example, an arrow to the left or right).
 
![Img1](/img/me15.png)

•	Each array (for example, set1_char0) contains 8 bytes. Each byte represents a line of 5 pixels. A 1 means the pixel is on, 0 means it's off. For example, 0b11111 means that the first 5 pixels of the line are on.

#### Character set display functions 

There are six functions, displaySet1() to displaySet6(), each responsible for displaying a specific set of custom characters on the LCD screen. Each of these functions takes a float value parameter.
