## Part Creation Process

#### Step 1: Initial Sketch
On the front plane, draw the following view while respecting the dimensions and angles.

![](/img/mec2.png)

#### Step 2: Base Extrusion
Use the extruded boss feature and extrude the selected region by **96.5 mm** using the mid-plane option.

#### Step 3: Trapezoid Shape
On the top plane, make the following sketch with a **6 mm offset** to get the trapezoid shape.

![](/img/mec5.png)

#### Step 4: Through Extrusion
Make a **through all** extruded boss.

![](/img/mec6.png)

#### Step 5: Material Removal Series
Proceed with a series of extruded cuts.

#### Step 6: First Cut
Make a **through all** extruded cut from the sketch.

![](/img/mec7.png)

#### Step 7: Bilateral Cuts
Using the first initial sketch, make an extruded cut on both sides of the region, leaving a **5 mm gap** between them. Each cut is made with a **2.5 mm offset**.

#### Step 8: Intermediate Result
After this operation, we obtain an intermediate part form.

#### Step 9: Additional Material Removal
Continue with material removals for the region of sketch 1 (the first sketch).

#### Step 10: Mid-plane Boss
Still using the first sketch, create a **5 mm extruded boss** with the mid-plane option.

#### Step 11: Final Features
By making an extruded boss from the sketch on the top plane and extruded cuts for the **10 mm holes**, we obtain the penultimate part.

#### Step 12: Final Part
Apply the material and the desired display mode. This gives us the final Test 3 part.

## Variable Dimension System

#### Step 13: Global Variables Setup
For this test, dimensions **A, B, Z, Y, X, W** must be modified to obtain a new part with a different mass each time. To achieve this:

1. Use the equation tool
2. Add global variables
3. Each time we modify these global variables, the dimensions are adjusted automatically
4. This generates a new part configuration

#### Step 14: Variable Linking Methods
When dimensioning to use variables:

**Method 1:** Use **"="** which allows selection of the variable in question

**Method 2:** Link the dimension already placed on the drawing to the global variable already created

#### Step 15: Multiple Configurations
At the end of this series of variable modification operations, we obtain **3 different pieces** of different masses. The masses of the pieces are designated as configurations a, b, and c.

**(a) A = 193 mm; B = 88 mm; W = B/2 mm; X = A/4 mm; Y = B+5.5 mm; Z = B+15mm;**

**The part mass is : 1400.64 gramms**

**(b) A = 205 mm; B = 100mm; W = B/2 mm; X = A/4 mm; Y =B+5.5 mm; Z = B+15 mm;**

**The part mass is : 1651.39 gramms**

<br />

**(c) A = 210 mm; B = 105 mm; W = B/2 mm; X = A/4 mm; Y = B+5.5 mm; Z = B+15mm;**

**The part mass is : 1760.41 gramms**

## Alternative Perspectives

Multiple paths allow for creating the same part. The part in this test can also be created using the following alternative method:

### Alternative Method A
On the top plane, create the following sketch and make an extruded boss of **"B" mm**.

### Alternative Method B
On the front plane, make the following sketch and proceed to remove extruded material to obtain the part.

### Alternative Method C
Use global variables or dimension directly on the sketches to have the three requested parts with the desired dimension specifications.

*Note: This document references multiple technical drawings and sketches that guide the 3D modeling process. The parametric approach using global variables allows for efficient generation of multiple part variants.*


## Bonus

The part mass is **7854,78 gramms**
